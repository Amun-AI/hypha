# Python Plugin Engine
The plugin engine used for running python plugins in https://imjoy.io

## Installation
  * Download and install **Python3.6+** version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
  * If you have never installed `git`, [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.
  * Run `pip install -U git+https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Python#egg=imjoy` in a terminal window



## Usage
  * Run `python -m imjoy` in a terminal and keep the window running.
  * Go to https://imjoy.io, connect to the plugin engine. For the first time, you will be asked to fill a token generated by the plugin engine from the previous step.
  * Now you can start to use plugins written in Python.

## FAQs
 * Can I use my existing python?
 
  It depends whether it's a conda-compatible distribution or not, try to type `conda -V` command, if you see a version number, it means you can install ImJoy directly with your existing python.
 * Can I use ImJoy with Python 2.7 or other version less than Python 3.6?
 
  Yes, you can once you have the conda environment. You will be able to install and run ImJoy with Anaconda/Miniconda with Python2.7. However, in that case, it will bootstrapping itself by creating a Python 3 environment (named `imjoy`) in order to run the actual plugin engine code. Therefore, Anaconda/Miniconda (Python3.6+ version) is still recommended if you have the choice.
 * What's the difference with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)?
 
 Miniconda is just a reduced version of Anaconda, since ImJoy only relies on `conda` which comes with both, you can choose either of them. If you like minimal installation, choose Miniconda. If you want all those packages which will be used for scientific computing(such as numpy, scipy, scikit-image etc.), choose Anaconda.
